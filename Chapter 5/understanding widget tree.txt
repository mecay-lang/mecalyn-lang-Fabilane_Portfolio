In this chapter, it helped me understand the concept of a widget tree in Flutter. A widget tree represents the hierarchical structure of widgets in a Flutter application. Each widget acts as a node in the tree, and their relationships define the app's UI, layout, and behavior. Although I still have limited knowledge about widget trees and haven't fully grasped them yet, this chapter provided me with some insights, which I truly appreciate.
